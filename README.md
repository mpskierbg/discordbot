# discordbot
I built this app with the help of YouTube and discord.js documentation and
several other resources. You need to download and install node.js.  once you have that installed try running the app by using npm or npm run index.  THis should get the app up and running. You will first need to use your own keys and secrets. You can get these by viting the discord developers site. If you have any questions please ask.
